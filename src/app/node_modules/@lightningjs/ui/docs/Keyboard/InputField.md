# Input Field

The Input Field component allows you to quickly display a label and cursor(optional) on screen that keeps itself up to date with the Keyboard component when both are linked together.

## Usage

If you want to use the InputField component, import it from Lightning UI.

```js
import { InputField } from '@lightningjs/ui'
```

### Initialize

To use the Input Field component you create an instance with the `type` InputField:

```js
class MyApp extends Lightning.Application {
    static _template() {
        return {
            MyInputField: {type: InputField},
            MyKeyboard: {type: Keyboard}
        }
    }

    _init() {
        const inputField = this.tag('InputField')
        this.tag('MyKeyboard').inputField(inputField)
    }
}
```

The Input Field component without a Keyboard component is a little bit useless so in this example we also added the Keyboard to the template. Beside adding it to the template you also need to connect the two components, you can do that by calling the `inputField` method of the Keyboard component. Generally you would do this in the _setup or _init method of your page. However you could have multiple Input Fields on one page so you can use it in any method.

### Customize

By default the Input Field looks very standard, for this reason we added some setters in order for you to easily customize your Input Field component. If you want to change anything related to the input text you can use the `inputText` setter:

```js
{
    MyInputField: {
        type: InputField,
        inputText: {
            fontSize: 44,
            fontFamily: 'MyFont-Regular',
            //basically any setter you can use when using a text texture
        }
    }
}
```

When you want to show a description of the Input Field when its empty you can use the `description` setter.

```js
{
    MyInputField: {
        type: InputField,
        description: 'Search...'
    }
}
```

You can also customize the cursor by using the `cursor` setter.

```js
{
    MyInputField: {
        type: InputField,
        cursor: {
            h: 40,
            w: 10,
            //anything you generally do when making Lightning tags
        }
    }
}
```
