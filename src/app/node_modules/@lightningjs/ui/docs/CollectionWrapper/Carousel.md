# Carousel

The Carousel component provides a Collection Wrapper to display Items in either a Row or a Column. What makes this component different from the List component is that it connects the end and start together, this way it appears to be going in a loop. This component is designed for finite collections.

## Usage

If you want to use the Carousel component, import it from Lightning UI.

```js
import { Carousel } from '@lightningjs/ui'
```

### Initialize

To use the Carousel component you create an instance with the `type` Carousel:

```js
class MyApp extends Lightning.Application {
    static _template() {
        return {
            MyCarousel: {type: Carousel}
        }
    }
}
```

You can pass additional parameters to your Carousel, for example if you want your Carousel to be displayed as a Row:

```js
{
    MyCarousel: {
        type: Carousel,
        direction: 'row'
    }
}
```

or if you want your Carousel to be displayed as a Column:
```js
{
    MyCarousel: {
        type: Carousel,
        direction: 'column'
    }
}
```

Please check the Setters for all available options.

## Available methods

### add
You can add items to the Carousel on the fly by using the `add` method:
```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').add(items)
```
The parameter `items` can either be an array, object, string, or number.

### addAt
You can add items to the Carousel at a starting from a specific index using the `addAt` method:
```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').addAt(items, index)
```
The parameter `items` can either be an array, object, string, or number. The parameter `index` should be a number starting from 0.

### reload
You can reload the Carousel with a new set of items by using the `reload` method.
```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').reload(items)
```
The parameter `items` can either be an array, object, string, or number. This method basically does a `clear` and `add`, in one call.

### removeAt
You can remove an Item at a specific index by using the `removeAt` method:
```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').removeAt(index)
```
The parameter `index` should be a number starting from 0.

### remove
You can let the Carousel remove a specific item by using the `remove` method:
```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').remove(item)
```
The parameter `item` should be a component that exists in the dataset of the Carousel.

### clear
You can clear al existing items in the Carousel by using the `clear` method:
```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').clear()
```

### reposition
You can reposition the itemWrappers when the items have been resized.
```js
//In the component where your Grid is initialized.
this.tag('MyCarousel').reposition()

//In a item component
this.collectionWrapper.reposition()
```

### setIndex
You can set the index of the Carousel by using the `setIndex` method: 
```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').setIndex(index)
```
The parameter `index` should be a number starting from 0.

### first
You can set the index to the first item in the Carousel by using the `first` method:
```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').first()
```

### last
You can set the index to the last item in the Carousel by using the `last` method:
```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').last()
```

### next
You can set the index to the next item in the Carousel by using the `next` method:
```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').next()
```

### previous
You can set the index to the previous item in the Carousel by using the `previous` method:
```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').previous()
```

### up
You can attempt to navigate upwards by using the `up` method:
```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').up()
```
This method returns `true` if the navigation was successful, or `false` if it was not successful.

### down
You can attempt to navigate downwards by using the `down` method:
```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').down()
```
This method returns `true` if the navigation was successful, or `false` if it was not successful.

### left
You can attempt to navigate left by using the `left` method:
```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').left()
```
This method returns `true` if the navigation was successful, or `false` if it was not successful.

### right
You can attempt to navigate right by using the `right` method:
```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').right()
```
This method returns `true` if the navigation was successful, or `false` if it was not successful.

## Signals

### onIndexChanged
This signal is fired when the index has changed. This signal generally comes with the following object:
```js
{
    index,
    previousIndex,
    dataLength
}
```

### onItemsRepositioned
This signal is fired when the Items have been repositioned by the Carousel.

## Setters

### direction
Sets the direction the Carousel starts building towards, this value should be `row` of `column`. Default and fallback value is `row`.

### spacing
Sets the fallback spacing between the items. Default value is 0(zero) `pixels`.

### itemType
Sets the default itemType the Carousel should use for the items. Expected input is a `Lightning.Component`.

### index
Sets the index of the Carousel. Expected input is a `number`.

### items
This setter `clears` the Carousel and `adds` the new Items to the Carousel. Expected input is an array, object, number, or string.

### scroll
Sets the scroll options for the Carousel. Expected input is a `float` starting from 0.0 until 1.0, a `number` representing pixels, an `object`, or a `function`.

```js
this.tag('MyCarousel').scroll = 0.5 //anchor the scroll to center (0.5 === 50%)
this.tag('MyCarousel').scroll = 200 //anchor the scroll to 200 pixels

this.tag('MyCarousel').scroll = {
    after: 3, //start scrolling after 3 items
    jump: 3, //after three items jump three Items
    forward: 0.9, //unless last item: scroll forward if item bounds are after 90% of the List, or if value is above 1; scroll after f.e. 900 pixels
    backward: 0.1, //unless first item: scroll backward if item bounds are before 10% of the List, or if value is above 1; scroll before f.e. 50 pixels
}

this.tag('MyCarousel').scroll = (itemWrapper, indexData) => {
    //calculation
    return myCalculateValue
}
```

### scrollTransition
Sets the scrollTransition. A transtion `object` generally used in Lightning is expected here.

### autoResize
Sets whether the bounds of the Carousel should resize to the size of the wrapper. Expected input is a `boolean`. Default value is `false`.

### enableRequests
Sets whether the Carousel should request for more data. Expected input is a `boolean`.

### requestThreshold
Sets how many Items before the end of the Carousel, the Carousel should start signaling for more data. Expected input is a `number`.

### gcThreshold
Sets how many Items should become inactive before the garbage collections is called. Expected input is a `number`.
